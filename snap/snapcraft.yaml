summary: Gemini reader snap
description: |
  This is a Gemini reader made in Go. Ultimately, my goal is to deploy the mobile
  app to my Android phone mainly because the app I tried from the Play store
  seemed to immediately trigger some text messages from telemarketers. Since the
  Gemini protocol was designed to encourage simple implementations, it seemed
  friendly enough. I also want to keep parity with the terminal program and be
  able to run that inside a remote SSH connection.
